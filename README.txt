The code is in a Jupyter file that can be run in a Jupyter enviroment with a python kernel*
* recommended python 3.11 or 3.10

Cells should be run in order. 

the last four cells are where the A* algorithm actually runs\
* the first two are for 3x3 puzzles
* the last two are for 4x4 problems

you can set the SIZE to constant to be any integer > 1 but i wouldn't recommended going past 4
be warned, solving a 4x4 takes ages.
